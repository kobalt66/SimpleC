# SimpleC

My little programming language project. (Not useable yet)

It is just an interpretation of what a C-like programming language could look like.
I just wanted to learn how to build up a system that provides classes, namespaces, and all that stuff.
For now, this project is probably not going to be a continuous one. I try to update this language for some time.
The language probably has some bugs that might be unfixable for me because of my little knowledge of how 
programming languages are built up.

Because this language is called SimpelC it of course does not have all the complex stuff C# or C++ provide.
Just keep in mind that this project is just a fun side project.

It would be awesome if you might get some inspiration from my work. :)

It is open source: Use it, if you want, or make it better.

# How does it work?

1. Copy the Test.sc, main.py and SimpleC.py file into a new vs code project.
2. Open a new terminal and run main.py with 'python3 .\main.py'
3. A custom console for SimpleC will show up '[@] >'
4. If you want to run Test.sc type 'runÂ§'
5. A new console element will appear '[FileName]'
6. Type 'Test.sc' into the console and press enter.
7. If the syntax is correct a long list of the parse result will be loaded into the console!

You can create a new SimpleC script inside the project.
(In step 6) To run those scripts you simply have to type in the file name of the script.


The code is constantly updating! It could be the case that the code you download might not work as
intended! Just wait for a new version of the code and your issues might be fixed.
