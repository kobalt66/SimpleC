# SimpleC

My little programming language project. (Not useable yet)

It is just an interpretation of what a C-like programming language could look like.
I just wanted to learn how to build up a system that provides classes, namespaces, and all that stuff.
For now, this project is probably not going to be a continuous one. I try to update this language for some time.
The language probably has some bugs that might be unfixable for me because of my little knowledge of how 
programming languages are built up.

Because this language is called SimpelC it of course does not have all the complex stuff C# or C++ provide.
E.g. you cannot put a namespace into a namespace and you cannot put a class into a class. (Just to keep it simple)

Just keep in mind that this project is just a fun side project.

It would be awesome if you might get some inspiration from my work. :)

It is open source: Use it, if you want, or make it better.
